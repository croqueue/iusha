# `sharptwoth`
A simple C library providing implementations of algorithms from the Secure Hash Standard (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512A/256)

## Overview
This library was originally hacked together in 2022 under a different name. Though the project served its original purpose quite well, it has lain dormant since then.  
  
I am re-opening the project so that it's original educational objectives can live-on. Although my original implementations pass all of the NIST's test vectors for the SHA-1 and the SHA-2 family algorithms, there are shortcuts in the original implementation that only those of us that fully digested the whitepaper might notice.

## Contributors
I am not accepting any contributors at this time and assert personal copyright for my implementation of these algorithms.
